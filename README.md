# Awesome Operators in the Wild

This is a fork from https://github.com/operator-framework/awesome-operators
which has been archived.

Operators are Kubernetes native applications. We define native as being both
managed using the Kubernetes APIs via kubectl and ran on Kubernetes as
containers. Operators take advantage of Kubernetesâ€™s extensibility to deliver
the automation advantages of cloud services like provisioning, scaling, and
backup/restore while being able to run anywhere that Kubernetes can run.

This list is built by the community. Have you built or are you using an Operator
that is not listed? Please send a pull request against [repos.txt](repos.txt).
